# androp

An application to allow sharing between Android and Macos.

As for the name "Androp", it comes from two words, "Android" and "Airdop",
and just like fusion in DBZ, you get an all new powerful warrior "Androp"

## Getting Started

Just clone the repo,
and get started like every other flutter project

## What to know

Well, basically the app structure is kept clean with "Clean architecture" and "Bloc" for state managment,
Yes, Bloc, it's not overkill..(smiles)..

# Supported platform,

Well for now, the app is just trying to create an Aidrop alternative for android users,
Connecting a wire is not always so convinient from guys who use a mac with an android device.

Eventually, "maybe" Androp will expand to linux too, that's why the linux folder remains in the project
