# flushare

An application to allow sharing between Android and Macos.

As for the name "flushare", it comes from two words, "flutter" and "share", easy right ?

## Getting Started

Just clone the repo,
and get started like every other flutter project

## What to know

Well, basically the app structure is kept clean with "Clean architecture" and "Bloc" for state managment,
Yes, Bloc, it's not overkill..(smiles)..

# Supported platform,

Well for now, the app is just trying to create an Airdrop alternative for android users,
Connecting a wire is not always so convinient from guys who use a mac with an android device.

Eventually, "maybe" flushare will expand to linux too, that's why the linux folder remains in the project
